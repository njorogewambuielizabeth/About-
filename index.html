    <p>Elizabeth is a young graduate from AkiraChix. She pursued a course in Information and Technology, her passion for tech begun early in highschool where 
        she did computer studies and was intrigued about how computers work and what Technologies are being used to communicate  with a computer. Funny fact was it was all 
        numbers just zeros and ones. That made me be inquisitive and want to know more. My desire led me into AkiraChix and i can certainly say that i do understand how things 
        work and now i use that knowledge to built websites, applications that help in solving world problems and making it easier for our people and generation.
Elizabeth loves traveling and trying out new things like foods, cultures and places. She also 
    loves quiet places like being around waterfalls or just flowing water. Elizabeth wants to achieve
    all her dreams by making sure she is upfront with the latest technologies in her career.
